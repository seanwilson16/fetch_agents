Scorigami is the concept of a final NFL score that has never happened before in league history. Originally popularized by sportswriter Jon Bois, Scorigami is a unique way to track NFL outcomes not just by who wins — but by the uniqueness of the final score itself.

Scorigami celebrates weirdness: scores like 11–8, 18–5, or 73–0 are rare and memorable. Every time a new score appears, it’s a Scorigami!

This agent, given any two positive integers less than 100, will tell you whether those two numbers are a possible NFL final score, if that final score has occurred before, the number of times it has occurred, and the most recent occurrence of that final score.
